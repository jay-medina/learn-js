/**
 * Design an interface that abstracts iteration over a collection of values. 
 * An object that provides this interface represents a sequence, and the 
 * interface must somehow make it possible for code that uses such an object to 
 * iterate over the sequence, looking at the element values it is made up of and 
 * having some way to find out when the end of the sequence is reached.
 * 
 * When you have specified your interface, try to write a function logFive that takes a 
 * sequence object and calls console.log on its first five elementsâ€”or fewer, if the sequence 
 * has fewer than five elements.
 * 
 * Then implement an object type ArraySeq that wraps an array and allows iteration over the 
 * array using the interface you designed. Implement another object type RangeSeq that iterates over 
 * a range of integers (taking from and to arguments to its constructor) instead.
